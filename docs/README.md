## Writing a good ML4H Paper
Extended Abstract 
An excellent extended abstract is one that leads to insight at the symposium through interaction with other attendees. This can be through presenting new ideas/ways of thinking, leading to insightful discussion and feedback, dissemination of new valuable resources, or enabling new opportunities for collaborations.

Extended abstract submissions should demonstrate that the work will produce fruitful discussion when presented at the symposium. Highlight opportunities for insightful discussion and demonstrate that your work will contribute to a creative, engaging, and constructive poster session. Reviewers will be explicitly asked to gauge how valuable they feel this work could be to other attendees of the event, as well as how valuable attending the event could be to the author of the abstract. This is not a license to submit low quality or barely begun work -- while these submissions may garner constructive comments during the review process, they will not likely generate useful discussions or insightful feedback during the event.

Reviewers will be asked to answer specific questions regarding the relevance to healthcare in the review form. It may be beneficial for authors to explicitly discuss these points in the abstract.

Exemplar abstracts
These abstracts from a prior yearâ€™s event presented preliminary, but promising ideas that served as good discussion points between the authors and other attendees.

Drug Repurposing for Cancer: An NLP Approach to Identify Low-Cost Therapies
Transfusion: Understanding Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging (This is the submitted, extended abstract version -- the work has also been published separately as a full paper, and interested readers should see that here)

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
In the last decades the use of Echochardiography is crucial in Intensive Care Units (ICU) advances of smaller US clinical devices, US image quality and functions and its real-time  capabilities to access cardiac anatomy and functions \cite{Feigenbaum1996, Vieillard-Baron2008, singh2007, cambell2018}.
However, despite the previous advances there is still challenges on finding standard views from experienced sonograpehrs that sometimes  such quantifcations are qualitative and subjective \cite{Feigenbaum1996}.

Assessing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is done at the point of care by clinicians with different expertise which is impacted on the rhythm and structural varations \cite{liu2021}.
However, automatic quantification of LVEF is still challenging at the point of care due to variation of protocols, skills levels \cite{field2011} and the nature of proving feedback on real-time \cite{liu2021}.

\section{Methods and materials}
Rank-2 non-negative matrix factorization \cite{yuan2017} and recently Robust Non-negative Matrix Factorization
\cite{dukler2018} are low-computation cost algorithms to automatic segment mitral valve.
Clustering techniques \cite{zhang2018} \cite{kusunose2021}.

A mathematical model in the form of a nonconvex constrained minimisation
problem, aimed to determine the 3D position of LV contours using 2D echocardiography
data for the entire cardiac cycle is proposed. It can be considered as a quadratically
constrained quadratic program in terms of one of four variables with the others fixed.
The model is solved by a proximal block coordinate descent method with cyclic order
and the convergence of the algorithm is proved by using the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. The model does not require unsuitable assumptions in practical environments and
numerical experiments show its suitability in working with real echocardiography data.

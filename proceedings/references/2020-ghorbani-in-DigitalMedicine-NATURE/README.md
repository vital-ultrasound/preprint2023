These results are sup-
ported by previous studies that showed population level
normative values for the chamber sizes of cardiac structures as
participants vary by age, sex, height, and weight. 27,28 Age-related
changes in the heart, in particular changing chamber sizes and
diastolic ﬁlling parameters, have been well characterized, 30,31 and
our study builds upon this body of work to demonstrate that these
signals are present to allow for prediction of these phenotypes to
a degree of precision not previously reported.




"As systemic
phenotypes of age, sex, and body mass index are highly correlated
with cardiovascular outcomes and overall life expectancy, the
ability of deep learning models to identify predictive latent
features suggest that future work on image-based deep learning
models can identify features hidden from human observers and
predict outcomes and mortality

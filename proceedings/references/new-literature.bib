abstract="Echocardiography image quality assessment is not a trivial issue in transthoracic examination. As the in vivo examination of heart structures gained prominence in cardiac diagnosis, it has been affirmed that accurate diagnosis of the left ventricle functions is hugely dependent on the quality of echo images. Up till now, visual assessment of echo images is highly subjective and requires specific definition under clinical pathologies. While poor-quality images impair quantifications and diagnosis, the inherent variations in echocardiographic image quality standards indicates the complexity faced among different observers and provides apparent evidence for incoherent assessment under clinical trials, especially with less experienced cardiologists. In this research, our aim was to analyse and define specific quality attributes mostly discussed by experts and present a fully trained convolutional neural network model for assessing such quality features objectively. A total of 1,650 anonymized B-Mode images with dissimilar frame lengths were stratified from most popular ultrasound vendors equipment and clinical quality scores were provided for each echo cine by Cardiologists at England's Hammersmith Hospital which fed our multi-stream architecture model. The regression model assesses the quality features for depth-gain, chamber clarity, interventricular (on-Axis) orientation and foreshortening of the left ventricle. Four independent scores are thus displayed on each frame which compares against cardiologists' manually assigned scores to validate the degree of objective accuracy or its absolute errors. Absolute errors were found to be {\textpm}0.02 and {\textpm}0.12 for model and inter observer variability, respectively. We achieved a computation speed of 0.0095Â ms per frame on GeForce 970, with feasibility for 2D/3D real-time deployment. The research outcome establishes the modality for the objective standardization of 2D echocardiographic image quality and provides a consistent objective scoring mechanism for echo image reliability and diagnosis.",

  abstract = 	 {Echocardiography monitors the heart movement for noninvasive diagnosis of heart diseases. It proves to be of profound practical importance as it combines low-cost portable instrumentation and rapid image acquisition without the risks of ionizing radiation. However, echocardiograms produce high-dimensional, noisy data which frequently proved difficult to interpret. As a solution, we propose a novel autoencoder-based framework, DeepHeartBeat, to learn human interpretable representations of cardiac cycles from cardiac ultrasound data. Our model encodes high dimensional observations by a cyclic trajectory in a lower dimensional space. We show that the learned parameters describing the latent trajectory are well interpretable and we demonstrate the versatility of our model by successfully applying it to various cardiologically relevant tasks, such as ejection fraction prediction and arrhythmia detection. As a result, DeepHeartBeat promises to serve as a valuable assistant tool for automating therapy decisions and guiding clinical care.}

abstract={The original description of M-mode echocardiography in 1953, by Inge Edler (1911-2001) and his physicist friend Hellmuth Hertz, marked the beginning of a new diagnostic noninvasive technique. Edler used this technique primarily for the preoperative study of mitral stenosis and diagnosis of mitral regurgitation. His work was carried forward by cardiologists all over the world, who developed Doppler, 2-dimensional, contrast, and transesophageal echocardiography. These are now standard in cardiologic examinations. Edler also influenced neurologists and obstetricians at Lund University (Sweden) to use ultrasound in their fields. For his landmark discovery, Edler is recognized as the "Father of Echocardiography."},

However, despite its ease of use, portability and accuracy, the diffusion of echocardiography among ICUs has been limited by various factors.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has influenced every field of cardiovascular imaging in all phases from acquisition to reporting. Compared with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, there is an issue of high observer variation in the interpretation of echocardiograms. Therefore, AI can help minimize the observer variation and provide accurate diagnosis in the field of echocardiography. In this review, we summarize the necessity for automated diagnosis in the echocardiographic field, and discuss the results of AI application to echocardiography and future perspectives. Currently, there are two roles for AI in cardiovascular imaging. One is the automation of tasks performed by humans, such as image segmentation, measurement of cardiac structural and functional parameters. The other is the discovery of clinically important insights. Most reported applications were focused on the automation of tasks. Moreover, algorithms that can obtain cardiac measurements are also being reported. In the next stage, AI can be expected to expand and enrich existing knowledge. With the continual evolution of technology, cardiologists should become well versed in this new knowledge of AI and be able to harness it as a tool. AI can be incorporated into everyday clinical practice and become a valuable aid for many healthcare professionals dealing with cardiovascular diseases.},

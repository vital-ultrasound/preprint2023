abstract = {Nuclear cataract (NC) is an age-related cataract disease. Cataract surgery is an effective method to improve the vision and life quality of NC patients. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images are noninvasive, reproductive, and easy-measured, which can capture opacity clearly on the lens nucleus region. However, automatic AS-OCT-based NC classification research has not been extensively studied. This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) framework named Adaptive Feature Squeeze Network (AFSNet) to classify NC severity levels automatically. In the AFSNet, we construct an adaptive feature squeeze module to dynamically squeeze local feature representations and update the relative importance of global feature representations, which is comprised of a squeeze block and a global adaptive pooling operation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a clinical AS-OCT image dataset and a public OCT images dataset, and results demonstrate our methodâ€™s effectiveness and superiority over strong baselines and previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, this paper also demonstrates that CNNs achieve better NC classification results on the nucleus region than the lens region. We also adopt the class activation mapping (CAM) technique to localize the discriminative regions that CNN models learned, which enhances the interpretability of classification results.}

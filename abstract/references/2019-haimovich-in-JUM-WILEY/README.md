abstract = {We describe a new graphical user interfaceâ€“based application, US-Pro, designed to enable customized, high-throughput ultrasound video anonymization and dynamic cropping before output to video or high-efficiency disk storage. This application is distributed in a Docker container environment, which supports facile software installation on the most commonly used operating systems, as well as local processing of data sets, precluding the external transfer of electronic protected health information. The US-Pro application will facilitate the reproducible production of large-scale ultrasound video data sets for varied applications, including machine-learning analysis, educational distribution, and quality assurance review.},

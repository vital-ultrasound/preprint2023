## Notes


"
2D videos were classified into views by one of two
different classifiers. The first classifier was a supervised
CNN, composed of four convolutional layers, a dense
layer, and a softmax output layer. This model was trained
with a categorical cross-entropy loss function. The
second classifier was a modified version of an
unsupervised deep clustering CNN [17] (appendix p 10),
trained with mean squared error and Kullback–Leibler
loss functions. The Doppler modalities view classifier
consisted of an ensemble of CNN models trained with
the echo or velocity trace images and the categorical
ground truth labels, with a categorical cross entropy loss
function and a softmax output layer (appendix p 10). We
trained the models on 55 487 images from 1145 individual
echocardiograms (appendix pp 2–3).

Classified views of 2D videos and Doppler modalities
were annotated. Experienced sonographers annotated a
total of 20 828 available images (appendix p 4) for training.
A combination of CNNs were used for annotating 2D
videos and doppler modalities

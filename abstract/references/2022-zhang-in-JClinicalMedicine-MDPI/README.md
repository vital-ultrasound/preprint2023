ABSTRACT = {The accurate assessment of left ventricular systolic function is crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) are the most critical indexes of cardiac systolic function. Echocardiography has become the mainstay of cardiac imaging for measuring LVEF and GLS because it is non-invasive, radiation-free, and allows for bedside operation and real-time processing. However, the human assessment of cardiac function depends on the sonographer&rsquo;s experience, and despite their years of training, inter-observer variability exists. In addition, GLS requires post-processing, which is time consuming and shows variability across different devices. Researchers have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges. The powerful learning capabilities of AI enable feature extraction, which helps to achieve accurate identification of cardiac structures and reliable estimation of the ventricular volume and myocardial motion. Hence, the automatic output of systolic function indexes can be achieved based on echocardiographic images. This review attempts to thoroughly explain the latest progress of AI in assessing left ventricular systolic function and differential diagnosis of heart diseases by echocardiography and discusses the challenges and promises of this new field.},

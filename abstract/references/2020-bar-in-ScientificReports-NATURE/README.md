## Notes

"Given that it is well established that even human surgeons require
well more the 100 repetitions of the same surgery to reach expert performance l ­ evels 16–18 and the fact that typical
video classification models in other domains are trained on more than 100,000 ­videos 19,20 , it seems unlikely the
results reported on a few dozen videos represent the true potential of AI for surgery.

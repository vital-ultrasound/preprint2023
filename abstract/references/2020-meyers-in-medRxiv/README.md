	abstract = {Background Quantifying ventricular biomechanics from fetal and neonatal echocardiograms presents unique and significant challenges. A new analysis workflow has been introduced for simultaneous quantification of flow and mechanics of cardiac function using an integrated set of automated, physics-based, echocardiography analysis methods.Methods We used in-house developed analysis algorithms to quantify ventricular biomechanics from four-chamber B-mode and color Doppler routine examination recordings for three hypoplastic left heart (HLHS) patients at 33-weeks{\textquoteright} gestation and first week post-birth along with age-matched controls. Chamber morphology, tissue motion, atrioventricular valve inflow, and hemodynamic flow parameters were measured.Results Prenatal cardiac output differed between control (LV:157 {\textpm} 139 mL/min, RV:257 {\textpm} 218 mL/min) and HLHS subjects (410 {\textpm} 128 mL/min). This difference persisted for control (LV:233 {\textpm} 74 mL/min, RV:242 {\textpm} 140 mL/min) and HLHS subjects (637 {\textpm} 298 mL/min) after birth. In utero peak early diastolic annulus velocity, e{\textquoteright}, was elevated in HLHS subjects ({\textpm} :1.88 {\textpm} 0.97cm/s) compared to controls (LV:1.23 {\textpm} 0.81cm/s, RV:1.19 {\textpm} 0.57cm/s). After birth e{\textquoteright} increased in control RVs (1.80 {\textpm} 0.73cms) compared to control LVs (1.26 {\textpm} 0.50cm/s) and HLHS RVs (1.18 {\textpm} 1.12cm/s). Postnatal early filling mitral flow velocity for the control subjects (LV:58.8 {\textpm} 17.6 cm/s) and early-filling tricuspid flow of the HLHS subjects (64.8 {\textpm} 23.7cm/s) were similar, while the late filling velocity decreased for the control subject LV (33.5 {\textpm} 8.1 cm/s) compared to the HLHS subjects (66.9 {\textpm} 23.0 cm/s). Importantly, flow energy loss in the fetal HLHS hearts was increased (0.35 {\textpm} 0.19 m3/s2) compared to the control subjects (LV:0.09 {\textpm} 0.07 m3/s2, RV:0.17 {\textpm} 0.12 m3/s2), and further increased postnatally for the HLHS subjects (0.55 {\textpm} 0.24 m3/s2) compared to the control subjects (LV:0.23 {\textpm} 0.20 m3/s2, RV:0.09 {\textpm} 0.06 m3/s2).Conclusions We demonstrate the feasibility of integrated quantitative measurements of fetal and neonatal ventricular hemodynamics and biomechanics using only four-chamber B-mode and color Doppler recordings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was supported, in part, by the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute funded, in part, by Grant Number UL1TR002529 from the National Institutes of Health, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Clinical and Translational Sciences Award.

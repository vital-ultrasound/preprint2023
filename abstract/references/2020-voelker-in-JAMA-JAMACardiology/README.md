    abstract = "{The FDA has authorized the first cardiac ultrasound software using artificial intelligence to guide clinicians in capturing diagnostic-quality images of a patientâ€™s heart.Called Caption Guidance, the software is indicated for use in adults undergoing 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography to obtain standard views of the heart from different angles.FDA officials said the software was developed using machine learning to train it to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable image quality. The software guides users on how to maneuver the ultrasound probe to acquire standard echocardiographic images and video clips of diagnostic quality. It automatically saves the best video clip from a particular view.}",

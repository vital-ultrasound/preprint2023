abstract = {We present the novel use of a deep learning–derived technology trained on the skilled hand movements of cardiac sonographers that guides novice users to acquire high-quality bedside cardiac ultrasound images. We illustrate its use at the point of care through a series of patient encounters in the COVID-19 intensive care unit. (Level of Difficulty: Beginner.)}

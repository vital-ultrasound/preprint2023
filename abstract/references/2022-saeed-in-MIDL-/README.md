## Notes

> While contrastive learning is an open research problem, we conclude from our experiments
that vanilla SimCLR pretraining could lead to an improvement in cardiac ultrasound seg-
mentation, especially when annotated data for the downstream task is limited. However,
it is crucial to pretrain on a large enough dataset to provide good results. Further exper-
imentation could lead to a better understanding of contrastive learning frameworks in the
context of cardiac ultrasound imaging. 

>Additionally, both SimCLR and BYOL
are sensitive to batch sizes and require very large batch sizes for optimal performance. Re-
gardless, our work has shown that SimCLR does work with minimal changes and moderate
resources.

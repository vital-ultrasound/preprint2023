## Notes

The ultrasound videos were annotated by an expert anes-
thesiologist using Annotation Web [15] to delineate nerves,
blood vessels and bone


The CNN architecture used in this study was a fully-
convolutional encoder-decoder U-net type network [16].

The real-time application devel-
oped (Fig. 5) was able to stream, process and visualize the
results in real-time using about 31 ms per frame on a laptop
with a GTX 1060 GPU.

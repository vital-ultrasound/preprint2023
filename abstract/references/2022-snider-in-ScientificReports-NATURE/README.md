abstract={Ultrasound imaging is essential for non-invasively diagnosing injuries where advanced diagnostics may not be possible. However, image interpretation remains a challenge as proper expertise may not be available. In response, artificial intelligence algorithms are being investigated to automate image analysis and diagnosis. Here, we highlight an image classification convolutional neural network for detecting shrapnel in ultrasound images. As an initial application, different shrapnel types and sizes were embedded first in a tissue mimicking phantom and then in swine thigh tissue. The algorithm architecture was optimized stepwise by minimizing validation loss and maximizing F1 score. The final algorithm design trained on tissue phantom image sets had an F1 score of 0.95 and an area under the ROC curve of 0.95. It maintained higher than a 90{\%} accuracy for each of 8 shrapnel types. When trained only on swine image sets, the optimized algorithm format had even higher metrics: F1 and area under the ROC curve of 0.99. Overall, the algorithm developed resulted in strong classification accuracy for both the tissue phantom and animal tissue. This framework can be applied to other trauma relevant imaging applications such as internal bleeding to further simplify trauma medicine when resources and image interpretation are scarce.},

## Notes

"Interestingly, these results are quite
close to those obtained by Pedrosa et al. [5]. Additionally,
the use of only 15 patients during the training phase illustrates
the strong potential of deep learning techniques to analyze
echocardiographic images."

tation and tracking in echocardiography using shape-based b-spline
explicit active surfaces,” IEEE Trans. Med. Imag., vol. 36, no. 11,

abstract = {Abstract A focused cardiac ultrasound performed by an emergency physician is becoming part of the standard assessment of patients in a variety of clinical situations. The development of inexpensive, portable handheld devices promises to make point-of-care ultrasound even more accessible over the coming decades. Many of these handheld devices are beginning to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) for image analysis. The integration of AI into focused cardiac ultrasound will have a number of implications for emergency physicians. This perspective presents an overview of the current state of AI research in echocardiography relevant to the emergency physician, as well as the future possibilities, challenges and risks of this technology.},

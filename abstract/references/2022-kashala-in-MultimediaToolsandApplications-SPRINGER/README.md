abstract={Nowadays working in the medical imaging domain remains a big challenge, since the collecting such datasets is so complex, deep learning techniques have accomplished great success in a diversity of applications across many disciplines. In current work, we have combined two novel neural networks for classifying liver lesions of Hepatocellular carcinoma, Metastases, Hemangiomas, and Healthy tissues. On the first model called FireNet, we have introduced fire modules to reduce the model size and the number of parameters for quick classification. The first part will be in charge of extracting spatial feature information.  The second model called Modified Long Short-Term Memory (MLstm), the features extracted by the FireNet are then used for temporal information and prediction with a new loss function called G-loss. In order to improve the proposed FireNet-MLstm model, a new bias was added through the forget gate. The activation function and the hyperbolic tangent were also added, which increased prediction accuracy. The dataset used in this study was collected by searching for the medical records with HCC, MET, HEM, and Healthy tissues in Jiangbin Hospital, the affiliated hospital of Jiangsu University from 2015 to 2018, with 120 patients, 30 patients with one or multiple Hcc, 26 patients with one or multiple Hem, 23 patients with one or multiple Met and 41 Healthy with non-lesion. The final classification accuracy of the proposed FireNet-MLstm model was 91.2{\%}.},

DESCRIPTION

This bundle provides:

   * jmlr class (article authors)
   * jmlrutils package (supplementary package automatically loaded by jmlr.cls)
   * jmlrbook class (for production editors, now obsolete)

The jmlr class was designed primarily for the Journal of
Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings 
(JMLR W&CP) based on the jmlrwcp2e package to make it easier for
production editors to combine articles into a single book.

JMLR W&CP has been renamed Proceedings of Machine Learning Research
(PMLR). Please use class option 'pmlr' for new articles.

If you want to submit an article to the Journal of Machine Learning
Research (JMLR), please follow their guidelines instead.

The jmlrutils package is automatically loaded by the jmlr class, but
may be used with other classes. (You may need to additionally load
graphicx and algorithm2e, which jmlr.cls does automatically.)

The jmlrbook class no longer works since it relies on another class
that has stopped working following modifications to the LaTeX kernel
in 2020. Production editors will now need to manually set the first
page number for each article. If a printed book is required, all
articles can be combined using pdfpages instead.

This doesn't affect article authors who can continue to use jmlr.cls.
